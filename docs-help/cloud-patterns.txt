#### SINGLE NODE PATTERNS ####

## SIDECAR PATTERN
Sidecar containers are coscheduled onto the same machine via an atomic container group, such as the pod API object in Kubernetes.
Sidecar containers also share a number of resources with the main application container.
It could be like adding HTTPS on a legacy HTTP application.
It could be used also to dynamically update configuration to the main application, with share volume between containers in pod.

## AMBASSADOR PATTERN
To access sharded service that exists somewhere in the world.
The sharded service also has a stateless load balancer that directs traffic to the appropriate shard.
The server is in fact actually a sharding ambassador proxy, which receives all of the requests from your application code, 
sends a request to the appropriate storage shard,and then returns the result to your application.


## ADAPTER PATTERN
Used to addapt heterogenous application to external applications.
One use case is monitoring all applications from a single point.

## REPLICATED LOAD BALANCING SERVICES
LB should know about health check and readines of a service because some services need a specific time to be available to process data.
Add cache in front of the system like Varnish.
